Here is where you will find all the code for my Arduino Sonar Project, just upload the .ino file to your Arduino and run the backend.py file 
(running frontendlib.py will terminate instantly)
Look in the comments in the code for additional info

I used the pyglet library for the visuals and the serial library for serial communications

Also if you have any constructive criticism to give, please reach out! Im kind of new to working with pyglet and python in general.
Feedback on the code's commenting is also greatly appreciated!
